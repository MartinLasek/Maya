# Maya

Take a photo and send it <-> receive one randomly in exchange.

I want to have a whole lot of fun getting deeper with image handling and manipulation and asynchronous programming!
That's on the one hand and on the other hand with API programming and everything from backend to frontend!
You can have a look at the backend part [MayaAPI](https://github.com/MartinLasek/MayaAPI), it is built with Vapor - a reaaally cool framework for serverside swift programming!
