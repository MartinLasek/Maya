# Maya

**Take a photo and send it - receive one randomly in exchange.**

I use this project to dive deep into image handling and manipulation and asynchronous programming in swift!

You can have a look at the API part [MayaAPI](https://github.com/MartinLasek/MayaAPI). It is built with [Vapor](https://github.com/vapor/vapor) - my favorite framework for serverside swift!
