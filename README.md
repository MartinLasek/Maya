# Maya
Take a photo, send it, receive one randomly in exchange.

I want to have alot alot alooot of fun learning about image manipulation and asynchronous programming from within an app!
That's on the one hand and on the other hand to learn about API programming and just everything fullstack!
You can have a look at the backend part MayaApi, it is built with Vapor - the coolest framework for serverside swift!
