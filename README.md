# Maya

Take a photo and send it - receive one randomly in exchange.

I am having alot of fun diving deep and deeper into image handling and manipulation and asynchronous programming in swift!
You can have a look at the backend part [MayaAPI](https://github.com/MartinLasek/MayaAPI), it is built with [Vapor](https://github.com/vapor/vapor) - a really cool framework for serverside swift!
